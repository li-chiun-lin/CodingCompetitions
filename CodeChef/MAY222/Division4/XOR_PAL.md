# Problem

You are given a binary string $A$ of length $N$.

You can perform the following type of operation on the string $A$:

- Choose two different indices $i$ and $j$ $(1\leq i,j\leq N)$;
- Change $A_i$ and $A_j$ to $A_i \oplus A_j$. Here $\oplus$ represents the bitwise XOR operation.

Find the minimum number of operations required to convert the given string into a palindrome.
