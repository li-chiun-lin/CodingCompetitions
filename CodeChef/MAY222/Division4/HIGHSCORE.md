# Problem

Chef is taking a tough examination. The question paper consists of $N$ objective problems and each problem has $4$ options $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, out of which, exactly one option is correct.

Since Chef did not study for the exam, he does not know the answer to any of the problems. Chef was looking nearby for help when his friend somehow communicated the following information:

- Exactly $N_A$ problems have option $A$ as the answer.
- Exactly $N_B$ problems have option $B$ as the answer.
- Exactly $N_C$ problems have option $C$ as the answer.
- Exactly $N_D$ problems have option $D$ as the answer.

Note that:

- $N_A+N_B+N_C+N_D=N$.
- Each problem is worth exactly $1$ mark and there is no negative marking.
- Even though Chef knows the number of correct options of each type, he does not know the correct answer to any problem.

Based on the given information, find the maximum marks Chef can guarantee if he marks the answers optimally.
