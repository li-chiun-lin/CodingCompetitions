# Problem

Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

- Chef decides to solve at least $10$ problems every week for $4$ weeks.

Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over $4$ weeks as $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$, output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.
