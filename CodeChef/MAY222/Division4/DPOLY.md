In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable $x$ with $N$ terms. The polynomial looks like $A_0 \cdot x^0+A_1 \cdot x^1+ \dots +A_{N−2} \dot x^{N−2}+A_{N−1} \cdot x^{N−1}$ where $A_{i−1}$ denotes the coefficient of the $i$th term $x^{i−1}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq N$.

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.
