# Problem

You are given an array $A$ of length $N$.
You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Choose any subsequence $S$ of the array $A$ and a positive integer $X$ such that $X$ is a power of $2$ and subtract $X$ from all the elements of the subsequence $S$.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal to $0$.
