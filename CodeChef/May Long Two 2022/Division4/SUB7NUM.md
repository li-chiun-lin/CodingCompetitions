# Problem

Kulyash has given you an array $A$ of size $N$.

He defines the subsequence-number of a non-empty subsequence $S$ of array $A$ as the number formed by the concatenation of all the elements of the subsequence $S$.

Find the count of non-empty subsequences of $A$ having their subsequence-numbers divisible by $7$. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo $10^9+7$.
