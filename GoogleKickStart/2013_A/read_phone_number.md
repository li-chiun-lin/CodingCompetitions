# Problem

Do you know how to read the phone numbers in English? Now let me tell you.

For example, In China, the phone numbers are 11 digits, like: 15012233444. Someone divides the numbers into 3-4-4 format, i.e. 150 1223 3444. While someone divides the numbers into 3-3-5 format, i.e. 150 122 33444. Different formats lead to different ways to read these numbers:

150 1223 3444 reads one five zero one double two three three triple four.

150 122 33444 reads one five zero one double two double three triple four.

Here comes the problem:

Given a list of phone numbers and the dividing formats, output the right ways to read these numbers.

Rules:

Single numbers just read them separately.

2 successive numbers use double.

3 successive numbers use triple.

4 successive numbers use quadruple.

5 successive numbers use quintuple.

6 successive numbers use sextuple.

7 successive numbers use septuple.

8 successive numbers use octuple.

9 successive numbers use nonuple.

10 successive numbers use decuple.

More than 10 successive numbers read them all separately.
