# Problem

Edison, a robot, does not have a right hand or eyes. As a brave robot, he always puts his left hand on the wall no matter he walks or turns around. Because he thinks it is too dangerous, Edison does not walk backward.

Assume that Edison has found himself in a square-shaped maze of NxN square cells which is surrounded by walls from the outside. In the maze, some of the cells are also walls. Edison can only move between two empty cells in four directions, north, south, west and east. In order to get out of the maze, he drafts a plan. He uses his left hand to lean on the wall and goes by following the wall.

Here is the question, is Edison able to get out of the maze in at most $10,000$ steps? If he can make it, output the path. By getting out of the maze, he only needs to be in the exit cell. If the starting cell is the same as the exit, Edison won't need to move and can directly get out of the maze.
