# Problem

The Constitution of a certain country states that the leader is the person with the name containing the greatest number of different alphabet letters. (The country uses the uppercase English alphabet from $A$ through $Z$.)

For example, the name **GOOGLE** has four different alphabet letters: **E, G, L, and O**. The name **APAC CODE JAM** has eight different letters. If the country only consists of these 2 persons, **APAC CODE JAM** would be the leader.

If there is a tie, the person whose name comes earliest in alphabetical order is the leader.

Given a list of names of the citizens of the country, can you determine who the leader is?
