# Problem

Ben works as an engineer in a city with $N$ electric junctions. These junctions form a network and can be visualised as a connected graph with $N$ vertices and $Nâˆ’1$ edges. The city is facing a power outage, due to which none of the junctions are receiving electricity, and Ben is in charge of handling the situation.

Each junction has a fixed electric capacity. $A_i$ is the electric capacity of the $i$-th junction. Due to resource constraints, Ben can provide electricity to only one junction, but other junctions can receive electricity depending on their connections and capacities. If the $i$-th junction receives electricity, then it will also get transmitted to all the junctions directly connected to the $i$-th junction whose capacity is strictly less than $A_i$. Transmission stops if no eligible junction is present. Help Ben determine the maximum number of junctions that can receive electricity.
