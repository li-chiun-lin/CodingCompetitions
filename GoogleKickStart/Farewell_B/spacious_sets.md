# Problem

Ada and John are best friends. Since they are getting bored, Ada asks John to solve a puzzle for her.

A set S is considered spacious if the absolute difference between each pair of distinct elements of S is at least K, that is, |x−y|≥K for all x,y∈S, with x≠y.

Ada has a list of distinct integers A of size N, and an integer K. For each Ai, she asks John to find the maximum size of a set Si made of elements from A, such that Si contains Ai and is spacious.

Note: The sets Si do not need to be made of consecutive elements from the list.
