# Problem

Alice and Bob both have a sweet tooth, and they are going to play a game to collect pancakes. There are N pancake stacks lined up on the table labeled from 1 to N. The i-th stack has exactly Ai pancakes. Alice and Bob are going to collect pancakes by alternating turns claiming full stacks. For the first turn, Alice must choose a stack labeled between La and Ra, inclusive, and claim it. Then, Bob must choose a stack labeled between Lb and Rb, inclusive, and different from the one chosen by Alice, and claim it.

In subsequent turns, each of them must choose an unclaimed stack that is adjacent to a stack they claimed themselves before. That is, for Alice to claim stack i on one of her turns other than the first, she must have claimed either stack iâˆ’1 or stack i+1 in one of her previous turns. The same is true for Bob. If at some point there is no valid choice for either player, they skip that turn and claim no stack.

The game ends when every stack is claimed. At that point, Alice collects all pancakes from all stacks she claimed, and Bob collects all pancakes in all stacks he claimed.

Alice wants to get as many pancakes as possible for herself, and Bob wants to get as many pancakes as possible for himself. Can you help Alice find out the maximum number of pancakes she can collect if they both play optimally?
