# Problem

Codejamon trainers are actively looking for monsters, but if you are not a trainer, these monsters could be really dangerous for you. You might want to find safe places that do not have any monsters!

Consider our world as a grid, and some of the cells have been occupied by monsters. We define a safe square as a grid-aligned $D \times D$ square of grid cells (with $D â‰¥ 1$) that does not contain any monsters. Your task is to find out how many safe squares (of any size) we have in the entire world.
