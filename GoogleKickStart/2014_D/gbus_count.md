# Problem

There exist some cities that are built along a straight road. The cities are numbered $1, 2, 3, \dots$ from left to right.

There are $N$ GBuses that operate along this road. For each GBus, we know the range of cities that it serves: the $i$-th gBus serves the cities with numbers between $A_i$ and $B_i$, inclusive.

We are interested in a particular subset of $P$ cities. For each of those cities, we need to find out how many GBuses serve that particular city.
