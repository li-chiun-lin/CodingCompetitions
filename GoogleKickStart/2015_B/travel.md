# Problem

There are $N$ cities in Chelsea's state (numbered starting from $1$, which is Chelsea's city), and $M$ bidirectional roads directly connect them. (A pair of cities may even be directly connected by more than one road.) Because of changes in traffic patterns, it may take different amounts of time to use a road at different times of day, depending on when the journey starts. (However, the direction traveled on the road does not matter -- traffic is always equally bad in both directions!) All trips on a road start (and end) exactly on the hour, and a trip on one road can be started instantaneously after finishing a trip on another road.

Chelsea loves to travel and is deciding where to go for her winter holiday trip. She wonders how quickly she can get from her city to various other destination cities, depending on what time she leaves her city. (Her route to her destination may include other intermediate cities on the way.) Can you answer all of her questions?
