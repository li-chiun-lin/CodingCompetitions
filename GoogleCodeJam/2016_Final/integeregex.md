# Problem

In this problem, a valid regular expression is one of the following. In the following descriptions, E1, E2, etc. denote (not necessarily different) valid regular expressions.

    A decimal digit: that is, one of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.
    Concatenation: E1E2.
    Disjunction: (E1|E2 |...|EN), for at least two expressions. Note that the outer parentheses are required.
    Repetition: (E1)*. Note that the outer parentheses are required.

For example, 7, 23, (7)*, (45)*, (1|2|3), ((2)*|3), (1|2|3), and ((0|1))* are valid expressions. (7), 4|5, 4*, (1|), and (0|1)* are not.

We say that an expression E matches a string of digits D if and only if at least one of the following is true:

    E = D.
    E = E1E2 and there exist D1 and D2 such that D = D1D2 and Ei matches Di.
    E = (E1| E2|...| EN) and at least one of the Ei matches D.
    E = (E1)* and there exist D1, D2, ..., DN for some non-negative integer N such that D = D1D2...DN and E1 matches each of the Di. In particular, note that (E1)* matches the empty string.

For example, the expression ((1|2))*3 matches 3, 13, 123, and 2221123, among other strings. However, it does not match 1234, 3123, 12, or 33, among other strings.

Given a valid regular expression R, for how many integers between A and B, inclusive, does R match the integer's base 10 representation (with no leading zeroes)?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow; each consists of two lines. The first line has two positive integers A and B: the inclusive limits of the integer range we are interested in. The second has a string R consisting only of characters in the set 0123456789()|*, which is guaranteed to be a valid regular expression as described in the statement above.
